I ended up buying the full version because I needed many different tabs on many different products because we don't drop ship, our items are handmade and each unique with unique ingredients. But because I can customize each tab, I can have a neatly laid out product pages on Shopify now instead of a bunch of necessary information that customers have to sift though about our skincare products that they might not care about or want to read but that I think is good info for them to know. Now, they can choose what information they want to know, and it's up to them to decide if they want to read it but for my peace of mind, it's there but not junking up the page now. This product is PERFECT for beginners or people who have an online business but don't know all the ins and outs of embedded code or page placements or app size modifications and want to see their changes in real time when they're doing it so that they can make sure that they're doing it correctly and not making a bunch of mistakes that they'll have to change once they publish the page. The tabs are straightforward without a bunch of time consuming choices to have to make. If you're like me, you want a product that doesn't have million things to choose from because either you get overwhelmed at the amount of choices or you waste a lot of time trying to tweak the look of your page that could be spent on more important things for your business or you make a bunch of mistakes because you don't know what you're doing! This app makes the process easy because it is limited. So, if you're looking for a fancy app that's going to suck up all your time trying to build a few tabs on your pages with a million choices for font, color, design, etc, then this app isn't for you. Or if you know what you're doing or you have a degree in website design or html code or something, then this app isn't for you, but if you have better things to do with your business besides create tabs or don't really know how to use tabs on your website pages or any fancy stuff because you are a beginner or are just not website or computer savvy, then get this app!

Best fix would be checking allowed cookies and make sure your browser isn't blocking third party cookies which is needed for the app to work.\nIf anyone else is experiencing this issue, check your settings on chrome and allow all cookies. You can check by clicking on the lock symbol next to the address bar to see if your browser is blocking any of them. Hope this helps. the app keeps telling to edit the items in bulk menu, i watched the youtube videos, when looked thru the listings, it only has 2 options, edit category or publish item. The tab to edit products is non existing. items cant be edited from the shopify walmart app. can this get fixed??", "helpful_count": "0", "developer_reply": "Hi Congo Tropicals,\nThank you for your feedback.

We have had multiple late orders in the Walmart Admin panel in the past few months either because they never were pushed through to Shopify and consequently to our order management system. Or because orders were shipped, but never updated as shipped back to the Walmart Admin Portal. What a disaster.
